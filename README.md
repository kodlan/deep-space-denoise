# Deep-space-denoise

Deep-learning denoiser for astrophotography images, built with PyTorch. Given a noisy astrophotography image,
produce a denoised version that preserves fine astronomical details (granulation, prominences, faint nebulae, stars).


## Features

- TBD

## Repository structure

- `data/raw` - raw images for datasets
- `docs/` — design, etc
  - datasets.md - datasets used in the project
  - requirements.md - project requirements
- `notebooks/`- notebook with some experiments

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourname/astro-denoiser.git
cd astro-denoiser
```
